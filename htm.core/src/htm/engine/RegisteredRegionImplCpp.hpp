/** @file
 * Definition of the RegisteredRegionImplCpp
 * Provides the plugin interface for the Cpp implemented Regions.
 * This is a subclass of RegisteredRegionImpl; the base class of an object that can instantiate
 * a plugin (a subclass of RegionImpl) and get its spec.
 *
 * the subclasses of RegistedRegionImpl must perform the following:
 *    1) Be Registered with the CPP engine using
 *              Network::registerCPPRegion(name, your_subclass);
 *       It only needs to be registed once even if multiple Regions will use
 *       an instance of the same plugin. The 'name' used in this registration
 *       is the 'nodeType' when calling Network::addRegion() to create a
 *       region. It is like declaring the type of the plugin.
 *       As a convention, the name used by C++ plugins will be the class name.
 *       The name for Python plugins should start with 'py_'. Those for CSharp
 *       will start with 'cs_'.
 *
 *    2) Override the destructor if needed to cleanup your RegisteredRegionImpl subclass
 *
 *    3) Instantiate the plugin and return its pointer when createRegionImpl()
 *       is called.
 *
 *    4) Instantiate and deserialize the plugin when deserializeRegionImpl() is called,
 *       returning its pointer. This gets called when Network::Network(path) is called
 *       to initialize an entire network from a previous serialization file.
 *
 *    5) Get and return a pointer to the spec from the plugin when createSpec() is called.
 *       The pointer returned from the plugin is cached by the RegionImplFactory class.
 *
