### HTM
HTM - nupic- reflex 



## Project Proposal
##	Check if we can modify the sequence/temporal memory/ nupic core with their datasets – June 26/27th
-	implement in pycharm/vs code – jen/pavia
-	make it run error-free – Jen/pavia
-	make sure it gives proper outputs - Jen
-	try to edit the sequence/temporal memory code – pavia
-	~~ create a git – pavia ~~
-	kalman filter - pavia
  
##	Implement the reflex memory with HTM core – 

##	Run the ECG dataset with HTM core code – 
-	Get normal baseline data
-	Label datasets for different anomalies
-	Make sure we have an anomaly score
-	Predicting the correct output
-	Classifying the anomaly

##	Use the reflex memory first-order cache to update synapses in sequence/temporal memory –
