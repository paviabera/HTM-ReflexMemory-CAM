## Parameter Differences
This is a comparison of parameters for python versions of this repository [htm.core](https://github.com/htm-community/htm.core) and [Numenta's NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic). Along with the [API_CHANGELOG](API_CHANGELOG.md) this serves as a guide when migrating your code or comparing the frameworks.

With w=21 a value of n=400 is typical\. The class enforces n > 6\*w\.                                                                           | 400     |
| sparsity   | Member "sparsity" is the fraction of bits in the encoded output which this encoder will activate\. This is an alternative way to specify the member "activeBits"\.                                                                                            | 0       |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         |

Numbers within \[offset\-resolution/2, offset\+resolution/2\] will fall into the same bucket and thus have an identical representation\. Adjacent buckets will differ in one bit\. resolution is a required parameter\. | \-      |
| activeBits | Member "activeBits" is the number of true bits in the encoded output SDR\. Was "w" in Numenta's NuPiC                                                                                                                                                         |         | w               | Number of bits to set in output\. w must be odd to avoid centering problems\. w must be large enough that spatial pooler columns will have a sufficiently large overlap to avoid false matches\. A value of w=21 is typical\.                                                                                   | 21      |
| radius     | Member "radius" Two inputs separated by more than the radius have non\-overlapping representations\. Two inputs separated by less than the radius will in general overlap in at least some of their bits\. You can think of this as the radius of the input\. |         |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         |
| Category   | Member "category" means that the inputs are enumerated categories\. If true then this encoder will only encode unsigned integers, and all inputs will have unique / non\-overlapping representations\.                                                        | FALSE   |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         |

| minPctOverlapDutyCycle | A number between 0 and 1\.0, used to set a floor on how often a column should have at least stimulusThreshold active inputs\. Periodically, each column looks at the overlap duty cycle of all other column within its inhibition radius and sets its own internal minimal acceptable duty cycle to: minPctDutyCycleBeforeInh \* max\(other columns' duty cycles\)\. On each iteration, any column whose overlap duty cycle falls below this computed value will get all of its permanence values boosted up by synPermActiveInc\. Raising all permanences in response to a sub\-par duty cycle before inhibition allows a cell to search for new inputs when either its previously learned inputs are no longer ever active, or when the vast majority of them have been "hijacked" by other columns\. | 0\.001  | minPctOverlapDutyCycle                             | A number between 0 and 1\.0, used to set a floor on how often a column should have at least stimulusThreshold active inputs\.
