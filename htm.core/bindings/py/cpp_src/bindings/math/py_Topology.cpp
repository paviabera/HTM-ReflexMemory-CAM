    input that each output can potentially be connected to. This
    can be thought of as the input bits that are visible to each
    output, or a 'receptive field' of the field of vision. A large
    enough value will result in global coverage, meaning
    that each output can potentially be connected to every input
    bit. This parameter defines a square (or hyper square) area: an
    output will have a max square potential pool with sides of
    length (2 * potentialRadius + 1).

Argument potentialPct: The percent of the inputs, within a output's
    potential radius, that an output can be connected to. If set to
    1, the output will be connected to every input within its
    potential radius. This parameter is used to give each output a
    unique potential pool when a large potentialRadius causes
    overlap between the outputs. At initialization time we choose
    ((2*potentialRadius + 1)^(# inputDimensions) * potentialPct)
    input bits to comprise the output's potential pool.
