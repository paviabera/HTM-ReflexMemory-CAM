## We'd love your help!

There are many ways you can help, regardless of your talents or how much time you're willing to give.

### Use Nupic!
The easiest way to contribute is to simply use this library and if you encounter any troubles then please open an issue on our github page or comment on an existing issue.  You can also contribute your program as an example of how to use this library.

### Develop Nupic!
If you'd like to develop this library itself, we have put together a list of tasks which don't require extensive knowledge of this library but nonetheless are important and need help.  Look for issues with the tag "newbie" which are a good starting point:

### Discuss Nupic!
We are open to new ideas and would be happy to discuss them.  To start the conversation, open an issue and we can talk about it.
