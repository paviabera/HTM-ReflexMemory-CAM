/**
 * ### Description
 * The Spatial Pooler is responsible for creating a sparse distributed
 * representation of the input. Given an input it computes a set of sparse
 * active columns and simultaneously updates its permanences, duty cycles,
 * etc.
 *
 * The primary public interfaces to this function are the "initialize"
 * and "compute" methods.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *     SpatialPooler sp;
 *     sp.initialize(inputDimensions, columnDimensions, <parameters>);
 *     while (true) {
 *        <get input vector>
 *        sp.compute(inputVector, learn, activeColumns)
 *        <do something with output>
 *     }

  /**
  Initialize the spatial pooler using the given parameters.

  @param inputDimensions A list of integers representing the
        dimensions of the input vector. Format is [height, width,
        depth, ...], where each value represents the size of the
        dimension. For a topology of one dimesion with 100 inputs
        use [100]. For a two dimensional topology of 10x5
        use [10,5].

  @param columnDimensions A list of integers representing the
        dimensions of the columns in the region. Format is [height,
        width, depth, ...], where each value represents the size of
        the dimension. For a topology of one dimesion with 2000
        columns use 2000, or [2000]. For a three dimensional
        topology of 32x64x16 use [32, 64, 16].

  @param potentialRadius This parameter deteremines the extent of the
        input that each column can potentially be connected to. This
        can be thought of as the input bits that are visible to each
        column, or a 'receptive field' of the field of vision. A large
        enough value will result in global coverage, meaning
        that each column can potentially be connected to every input
        bit. This parameter defines a square (or hyper square) area: a
        column will have a max square potential pool with sides of
        length `(2 * potentialRadius + 1)`, rounded to fit into each dimension.

  @param potentialPct The percent of the inputs, within a column's
        potential radius, that a column can be connected to. If set to
        1, the column will be connected to every input within its
        potential radius. This parameter is used to give each column a
        unique potential pool when a large potentialRadius causes
        overlap between the columns. At initialization time we choose
        ((2*potentialRadius + 1)^(# inputDimensions) * potentialPct)
        input bits to comprise the column's potential pool.

  @param globalInhibition If true, then during inhibition phase the
        winning columns are selected as the most active columns from the
        region as a whole. Otherwise, the winning columns are selected
        with resepct to their local neighborhoods. Global inhibition
        boosts performance significantly but there is no topology at the
        output.

  @param localAreaDensity The desired density of active columns within
        a local inhibition area (the size of which is set by the
        internally calculated inhibitionRadius, which is in turn
        determined from the average size of the connected potential
        pools of all columns). The inhibition logic will insure that at
        most N columns remain ON within a local inhibition area, where
        N = localAreaDensity * (total number of columns in inhibition
        area)
        Default: 0.05 (5%)

	If localAreaDensity is set to any value less than  0, 
	output sparsity will be determined by the numActivePerInhArea.

  @param numActiveColumnsPerInhArea An alternate way to control the sparsity of
        active columns. When numActivePerInhArea > 0, the inhibition logic will insure that
        at most 'numActivePerInhArea' columns remain ON within a local
        inhibition area (the size of which is set by the internally
        calculated inhibitionRadius). When using this method, as columns
        learn and grow their effective receptive fields, the
        inhibitionRadius will grow, and hence the net density of the
        active columns will *decrease*. This is in contrast to the
        localAreaDensity method, which keeps the density of active
        columns the same regardless of the size of their receptive
        fields.
	If numActivePerInhArea is specified (> 0) then it overrides localAreaDensity. 

  @param stimulusThreshold This is a number specifying the minimum
        number of synapses that must be active in order for a column to
        turn ON. The purpose of this is to prevent noisy input from
        activating columns.

  @param synPermInactiveDec The amount by which the permanence of an
        inactive synapse is decremented in each learning step.

  @param synPermActiveInc The amount by which the permanence of an
        active synapse is incremented in each round.

  @param synPermConnected The default connected threshold. Any synapse
        whose permanence value is above the connected threshold is
        a "connected synapse", meaning it can contribute to
        the cell's firing.

  @param minPctOverlapDutyCycles A number between 0 and 1.0, used to set
        a floor on how often a column should have at least
        stimulusThreshold active inputs. Periodically, each column looks
        at the overlap duty cycle of all other column within its
        inhibition radius and sets its own internal minimal acceptable
        duty cycle to: minPctDutyCycleBeforeInh * max(other columns'
        duty cycles). On each iteration, any column whose overlap duty
        cycle falls below this computed value will get all of its
        permanence values boosted up by synPermActiveInc. Raising all
        permanences in response to a sub-par duty cycle before
        inhibition allows a cell to search for new inputs when either
        its previously learned inputs are no longer ever active, or when
        the vast majority of them have been "hijacked" by other columns.

  @param dutyCyclePeriod The period used to calculate duty cycles.
        Higher values make it take longer to respond to changes in
        boost. Shorter values make it potentially more unstable and
        likely to oscillate.

  @param boostStrength A number greater or equal than 0, used to
        control boosting strength. 
	No boosting is applied if it is set to 0.0, (runs faster due to skipped code).
        The strength of boosting increases as a function of boostStrength.
        Boosting encourages columns to have similar activeDutyCycles as their
        neighbors, which will lead to more efficient use of columns. However,
        too much boosting may also lead to instability of SP outputs.


  @param seed Seed for our random number generator. If seed is < 0
        a randomly generated seed is used. The behavior of the spatial
        pooler is deterministic once the seed is set.

  @param spVerbosity spVerbosity level: 0, 1, 2, or 3

  @param wrapAround boolean value that determines whether or not inputs
        at the beginning and end of an input dimension are considered
        neighbors for the purpose of mapping inputs to columns.

  /**
  This is the main workshorse method of the SpatialPooler class. This
  method takes an input SDR and computes the set of output active
  columns. If 'learn' is set to True, this method also performs
  learning.

  @param input An SDR that comprises the input to the spatial pooler.  The size
        of the SDR must mach total number of input bits implied by the
        constructor (also returned by the method getNumInputs).

  @param learn A boolean value indicating whether learning should be
        performed. Learning entails updating the permanence values of
        the synapses, duty cycles, etc. Learning is typically on but
        setting learning to 'off' is useful for analyzing the current
        state of the SP. For example, you might want to feed in various
        inputs and examine the resulting SDR's. Note that if learning
        is off, boosting is turned off and columns that have never won
        will be removed from activeVector.  TODO: we may want to keep
        boosting on even when learning is off.

  @param active An SDR representing the winning columns after
        inhibition. The size of the SDR is equal to the number of
        columns (also returned by the method getNumColumns).

  @return overlap
        an int vector containing the overlap score for each column. The
        overlap score for a column is defined as the number of synapses in
        a "connected state" (connected synapses) that are connected to
        input bits which are turned on.
